## Our goal

**Build a really good notes app for students on Android.**

Students on iPad have excellent handwriting apps. On Android there are very few good ones: most are closed, tied to one brand, or feel like ports. BestNote is an open, community-built answer. We want a student with a Galaxy Tab (or any Android tablet or phone) to run a whole semester in it: lectures, PDF slides, formulas, diagrams, and revision, in any language, without an account, ads or a subscription.

If you are a student, a developer, a designer, or someone who just loves good tools, **this project is for you and we want your help.**

## What makes it different

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### Ink that feels right
Pressure-sensitive pens (fountain, ball, brush, pencil, highlighter), tuned for the Samsung S Pen: low latency, palm rejection, hover cursor, side-button eraser.

### Arabic and RTL are first class
Arabic, Hebrew and English side by side on one page. Right-to-left UI and a font picker that understands Arabic scripts.

### Your notes stay yours
No account, no ads, no tracking, no paywall. Works fully offline. Open file format and export.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### Smart Board
Photograph a whiteboard and get clean, ordered study notes with straight diagrams, meaningful colors and equations. Opt-in and bring your own AI key; the core app never needs the network.

### Built for studying
Equations, shapes that stay connected when you move them, lasso selection, a page manager and dark mode. PDF annotation and more are on the [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md).

### Open and hackable
Modular Kotlin and Jetpack Compose codebase with documented architecture, numbered tasks and a clear contribution flow.

## Status

**Early and moving fast.** The app already builds, writes, and ships test builds (latest: see [Releases](https://github.com/alidiab2/BestNote/releases)). It is **not 1.0 yet**: expect rough edges. Milestones and what is done are in the [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md).

## Try it

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/alidiab2/BestNote/releases/latest) and download the `.apk`.
2. Allow "Install unknown apps" for your browser or file manager when Android asks.
3. Open BestNote and start writing. Best on a Galaxy Tab with an S Pen, but any Android device works.

## Help us build it

You do not need to ask permission, just pick something:

- **Pick a task.** [`docs/workstreams/`](docs/workstreams/) has 12 workstreams with numbered, sized tasks (like `INK-03`) and clear "done" criteria.
- **Test and report.** Try a build on your device and open an issue. Different tablets and S Pen models are very valuable.
- **Design.** Interactive mockups live in [`design/`](design/). Propose improvements.
- **Translate.** Arabic is in; more languages are welcome.
- **Students: tell us what you need.** Real study workflows decide what we build next.

Start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Questions and ideas are welcome in Issues.

## Build from source

Requires JDK 17 and Android SDK platform 37.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alidiab2/BestNote.git
cd BestNote
./gradlew assembleDebug test
./gradlew :app:installDebug
```
